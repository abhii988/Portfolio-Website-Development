# Portfolio-Website-Development
Portfolio Website Development created using HTML, CSS and Js

The aim of this assessment was to create our own portfolio website. 
It was made by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It also had a section for CV and a blog written by me too.
It is a responsive website which focuses on aesthetic and user interface along with some back end functionality.
