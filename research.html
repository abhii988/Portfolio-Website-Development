I liked how the website has very minimalistic view and is clean. I made my homepage somewhat similar to it and gave my homepage a clean view. It was pretty hard to make the navigation box and the detail box down below. I used CSS to determine their size, placement, styling and designing. Using javascript, it asks the user for their name as an input and displays it on the front and for the image slideshow.</p>

Other websites have colorful and design filled navigation bar which I dislike. So, due to its polied navigation bar, I used it in my website as a navigation medium for the user to go through my pages with ease. I also added a logo on the left corner of the navigation bar which is of redsnow jailbreak. The navigation bar was not that hard to make. The color of apple's navigation bar is grey but mine is black. I did this because of the logo. I couldn't find this logo with a tramsparent background. I only found it with black background, so I made my navigation bar black.</p>

This part was the most easiest part to do. It took me no longer than ten minutes to design this page. But I also added a gradient background in this page which I had acquired from the page <a href="http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor">colorzilla.com</a>.</p>

This example has helped me quite a bit to write my own CV. It was hard to make this page as the placements of different texts and the image was to be done. I used the help of CSS to design and style this page and make it simple and attractive. I had difficulty in manage the size of the text and mainly creating the upper portion of this page as the image is at the left and the text is at the right was quite hard to do.</p>
